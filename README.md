A flow-field based visualiser that can optionally provide song information via an integration with ACRCloud.

Profiles can be edited and saved, with an option to restore to the default. 

Controls can be toggled by clicking anywhere on the screen, or pressing the 'C' key. If a song's been detected, details can be toggled by pressing 'S'.

An access key & access secret will be required to use the identification functionality. Accounts with a free trial, plus a limited number of free requests, can be created at https://www.acrcloud.com/

Access credentials and saved profiles are stored in your browser's local storage.
